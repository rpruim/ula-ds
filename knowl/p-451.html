<div class="para">Broadcasting will treat each array is if it had shape <span class="process-math">\((3, 5, 10)\text{.}\)</span>  To do that, each array must be "stretched".  Broadcasting treats <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as if it were <span class="process-math">\(A^*\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(A^*[i, j, k] == A[i, 1, k]\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is treated as if it were <span class="process-math">\(B^*\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(B^*[i,j,k] = B[j, k]\text{.}\)</span>  That is, each array is treated as if data were copied to fill in the missing dimensions. Importantly for computational efficiency, this copying does not actually happen. But conceptually, we can imagine that copying if it helps us understand how the arrays are made compatible.</div>
