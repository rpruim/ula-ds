<div class="para">The data/computer science perspective.</div>
<div class="para">Probably the simplest way to think about a vector is as an ordered list of numbers. This is how we will usually represent vectors in the computer. This is also what allows us to connect linear algebra to data. Suppose we have selling prices of 100 homes, for example. We could put those 100 numbers into an ordered list and call it a vector of home prices. That allows us to think about all 100 home prices together as one unit -- the selling price of (these particular 100) homes. This kind of vector can be called a <dfn class="terminology">variable vector</dfn> since in contains all the information about one variable (in this case price). A richer data set could have many variables, each one stored as a vector. </div>
<div class="para">Alternatively, we may consider a single home and record several different pieces of information about it (selling price, number of bedrooms, size of the lot, etc.). All the information about one home can be stored as a vector. This kind of variable can be called a <dfn class="terminology">sample vector</dfn> or a <dfn class="terminology">case vector</dfn>, since the vector represents one observational unit. A large data set will consist of many case vectors. </div>
<div class="para">When working with data, our list of numbers might be very long. We could have hundreds, or thousands, or millions, or more cases or variables that we are keeping track of. The good news is that vectors behave the same way no matter how long the list of numbers. This means we can learn a lot from smaller examples, which are easier to work with (and visualize).</div>
<div class="para">So letâ€™s consider some smaller examples. <span class="process-math">\(\vvec = \left[
\begin{array}{r}
2 \\
1 \\
\end{array}
\right]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\wvec = \left[
\begin{array}{r}
-3 \\
1 \\
0 \\
2 \\
\end{array}
\right]\)</span> are both vectors. The entries in a vector are called its <dfn class="terminology">components</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">entries</dfn>. Since the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\)</span> has two components, we say that it is a two-dimensional vector; in the same way, the vector <span class="process-math">\(\wvec\)</span> is a four-dimensional vector. </div>
<div class="para">Because the numbers we are using are "real" numbers (numbers of any size that can be represented as fractions or decimals), we will denote the set of all <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>-dimensional vectors by <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, if <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is a 3-dimensional vector, we say that <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\)</span> (written <span class="process-math">\(\uvec \in
\real^3\)</span>). Note that this will require us to recode non-numeric data using numbers. </div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-vectors.html#li-7" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
