<div class="para">It’s certainly true that higher degree polynomials fit the data better, as seen by the increasing values of <span class="process-math">\(R^2\text{,}\)</span> but that’s not always a good thing. For instance, when <span class="process-math">\(k=11\text{,}\)</span> you may notice that the graph of the polynomial wiggles a little more than we would expect. In this case, the polynomial is trying too hard to fit the data, which usually contains some uncertainty, especially if it’s obtained from measurements.  The error built in to the data is called <dfn class="terminology">noise</dfn>, and its presence means that we shouldn’t expect our polynomial to fit the data perfectly.  When we choose a polynomial whose degree is too high, we give the noise too much influence over the fit of the model, which leads to some undesirable behavior, like the wiggles in the graph.</div>
<div class="para">Fitting the data with a function that is too flexible and fits the training data better than it can be expected to fit new data high is called <dfn class="terminology">overfitting</dfn>, a phenomenon that can appear in many machine learning applications. Generally speaking, we would like to choose <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> large enough to capture the essential features of the data but not so large that we overfit and build the noise into the model.  What we really need is a method for selecting a good value for <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and a better way to measure how well we should expect the model to fit <em class="emphasis">new</em> data, not the data used to train the model. That discussion would take us too far afield for the moment, but it is an important discussion.</div>
