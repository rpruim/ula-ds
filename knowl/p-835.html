<div class="para">There are many computational tools that could be used.  One of them, Matlab (and its open source analog, Octave), was specifically designed (and named) with matrix algebra as its primary use case.  Linear algebra is important for statistics and machine learning, but so are other things, like data wrangling and visualing data and models.  For this reason, langauges like R and Python are much more important in the data science community. Although linear algebra is used extensively in both languages, end users of Python are more likely to manipulate data in vector and matrix format than are users of R, where this is often hidden behind an additional layer of abstraction. For this reason, weâ€™ll focus primarily on Python in this text, with some references to how things differ in R thrown in along the way.</div>
