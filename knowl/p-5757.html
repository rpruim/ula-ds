<div class="para">As we have seen, we can use the dot product to compute the angle between two vectors. This angle (or the cosine of the angle) is often taken as a measure of "similarity" between two vectors. For example, consider the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\wvec\text{,}\)</span> shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-similar-vectors.html" title="Figure 6.1.17">FigureÂ 6.1.17</a>.  The vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\wvec\)</span> seem somewhat similar as the directions they define are nearly the same.  By comparison, <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> appears rather dissimilar to both <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\wvec\text{.}\)</span>  We will measure the similarity of vectors by finding the angle between them; the smaller the angle, the more similar the vectors. This is especially useful in contexts where the direction of a vector conveys more important information than its magnitude.</div>
