<div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n \by n\)</span> and has a right inverse <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Then for any <span class="process-math">\(\bvec \in \real^n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(AR\bvec = \bvec\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(A \xvec = \bvec\)</span> is consistent for every <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\text{.}\)</span>  This implies that the RREF of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has a pivot in each row, and therefore also in each column.  In other words, <span class="process-math">\(A \sim I\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Notice that if <span class="process-math">\(R\xvec = R \yvec\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\xvec = AR \xvec = AR \yvec = \yvec\text{.}\)</span> This means the matrix transformation associated with <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is one-to-one, so the RREF for <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> has a pivot in every column, and therefore in every row.  In other words, <span class="process-math">\(R \sim I\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now consider <span class="process-math">\(RA \xvec\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(\xvec \in \real^n\text{.}\)</span>  Because <span class="process-math">\(R \sim I\text{,}\)</span> there must be a <span class="process-math">\(\yvec\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(R \yvec = \xvec\text{.}\)</span> So</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
RA \xvec = RAR \yvec = R \yvec = \xvec
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">But this means that <span class="process-math">\(RA\)</span> is the identity matrix since the transformation associated with it is the identity transformation.  In other words, <span class="process-math">\(RA = I\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is also a left inverse of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Now suppose that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is a left inverse for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> That means <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a right inverse for <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> and we just show that this means <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is also a left inverse for <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(AL = I\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is a right inverse for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
