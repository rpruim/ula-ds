<div class="para">Notice that this is the same result we would get from <span class="process-math">\(\tilde Q \threevec{12}{-25}{0}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\tilde Q\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> augmented with an additional column for the third principal component. In other words, our estimate is produced using the average value along the direction of the third principal comonent rather than the actual value. This is only an estimate because not all values are average. If the eigenvalue associated with the third eigenvector are small (so the variance in that direction is small), then most of the points cluster very close to average and the prediction will be good. But if the variance is larger, many of the points may be farther away from the average, and the prediction may not be as good.</div>
