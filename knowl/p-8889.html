<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are several add-on pacakges that are useful for linear algebra. The ones used here are part of the SciPy "ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering." Core packages in this suite include</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">NumPy (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">import numpy as np</code>).</span></span><div class="para"><blockquote class="blockquote">NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.</blockquote></div>
<div class="para">Note: NumPy includes both the 2-dimensional arrays (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">np.array()</code>) and matrices (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">np.matrix()</code>). The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">numpy.matrix</code> class makes certain things a bit more convenient, but we will follow SciPy advice: <blockquote class="blockquote">Despite its convenience, the use of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">numpy.matrix</code> is discouraged, since it adds nothing that cannot be accomplished with 2-D numpy.ndarray objects, and may lead to a confusion of which class is being used.</blockquote>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">SciPy Linear Algebra" (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">from scipy import linalg</code>).</span></span><div class="para">SciPy is a large library with many packages and submodules. We will primarily use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">scipy.linalg</code>, which contains many linear algebra functions.</div>
<div class="para">Note that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">np.linalg</code> also exists. Here’s what SciPy has to say about that: <blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="para">"scipy.linalg contains all the functions in numpy.linalg plus some other more advanced ones not contained in numpy.linalg. Another advantage of using scipy.linalg over numpy.linalg is that it is always compiled with BLAS/LAPACK support, while for numpy this is optional. Therefore, the scipy version might be faster depending on how numpy was installed.</div> <div class="para">Therefore, unless you don’t want to add scipy as a dependency to your numpy program, use scipy.linalg instead of numpy.linalg."</div>

Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.</blockquote></div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">SymPy (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">import sympy</code>).</span></span><div class="para"><blockquote class="blockquote">SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.</blockquote></div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">pandas (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">import pandas as pd </code>).</span></span><div class="para"><blockquote class="blockquote">pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.</blockquote></div>
<div class="para">The primary feature of pandas that we will use is its support for <dfn class="terminology">data frames</dfn>. In a data frame, each row represents and observational unit and each column represents a variable. Different variables may be of different types and need not be numeric. pandas allows us to read data frames in from files of various formats (e.g., CSV files) and to perform data wrangling on the result.</div>
