<div class="para">This exercise concerns systems of equations having three unknowns.  In this case, we know that the solution space of a single equation is a plane.  If it helps with visualization, consider using <span class="process-math">\(3\by5\)</span> index cards to represent planes.</div> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Is it possible that the solution space of a system of four equations in three unknowns is a line?  Either sketch an example or give a reason why it can’t happen.</div></li>
