<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">David Austin generously made the source of his <em class="emphasis">Understanding Linear Algebra</em> publicly available and licensed so that others could make modifications.  The <em class="emphasis">Data Science Edition</em> is one example. You may be wondering how the two compare and which is the right version for you. Here is a summary of differences between the two editions.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Python instead of sage.</span></span><div class="para">This is probably the biggest and most noticeable change. This edition uses Python and important Python libraries for data science, like <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">numpy</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">scipy</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pandas</code>. Data scientists are much more likely to encounter these tools than they are to use Sage.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">A different starting point.</span></span><div class="para">The original version motivates linear algebra through an attempt to solve linear systems of equations. That is an important application, but why do we want to solve linear systems in the first place, and how is that related to data science?</div>
<div class="para">This edition begins by exploring how vectors and matrices can be used to store data and emphasizing three complementary ways to think about vectors, which we might call the data science perspective, the geometry perspective, and the mathematical perspective. Right from the start, we want to develop skill in moving among these three ways of thinking.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Some additional data science applications.</span></span><div class="para">Linear models make their first appearance much earlier -- as an example of linear combinations and matrix-vector multiplication, even though least squares methods donâ€™t come until later.  Tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) are introduced immediately after matrices, in part because they help demystify how <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">numpy</code> approaches things like  aggregation with matrices, and in part because many data science applications make use of higher-dimensional arrays.</div>
<div class="para">Over time, I hope to add additional data science examples.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">A different approach to the dot product.</span></span><div class="para">The traditional approach begins with a computational form and links this to geometry using the Law of Cosines, a result that is unfamiliar to many students.  The result is that the computational and geometric forms can seem unrelated, and projections can feel a bit mysterious.</div>
<div class="para">Here we motivate dot products from a desire to compute projections and establish the connection to the computational formala without citing the Law of Cosines. Our hope is that this will make  these topics feel more natural and intuitive.  In the end, we will end in the same place, relying on the important interplay between three ways of thinking: data-centric, geometric, and mathematical.</div>
