</h5> <div class="para">It is important to be able to distinguish vectors from scalars. You may have noticed that we have been using bold (lower case) letters to represent vectors.  This will be our standard notation to help us distinguish vectors from scalars, which we will not put inbold.</div> <div class="para">You may have seen other notation for vectors, including notation that places a small arrow above variables representing vectors. That notation works poorly in statistical contexts where that space is often used for other things (e.g., <span class="process-math">\(\hat{\xvec}, \overline{\xvec}, \tilde{\xvec}, \dots\)</span>).</div> <div class="para">When writing by hand, bold is tricky.  We suggest placing a "wiggle" below letters that would be typeset in bold.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-vectors.html#remark-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
