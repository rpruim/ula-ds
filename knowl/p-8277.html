<div class="para">This dataset is a bit different from others that weâ€™ve looked at because the scale of the measurements is significantly different.  For instance, the measurements for the body mass are roughly 100 times as large as those for the culmen length. For this reason, we will standardize the data by first demeaning it, as usual, and then rescaling each measurement by the reciprocal of its standard deviation.  The result is stored in the <span class="process-math">\(4\by333\)</span> matrix <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A</code>.</div>
