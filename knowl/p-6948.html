<div class="para">You may wonder why the approach in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-toy-normal-equation.html" title="Example 6.5.9">Example 6.5.9</a> is better than the original appraoch.  Here’s one reason why.  Suppose we have a larger example and <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n\by m\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> much larger than <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> as is often the case. Then <span class="process-math">\(X^{\transpose} X\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(p\by p\text{,}\)</span> which is small. But <span class="process-math">\(X  X^\transpose\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n \by n\text{,}\)</span> which is large -- much larger than <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>  So computing <span class="process-math">\(\yhat = \proj{\yvec}{\col(X)} = X X^{\transpose} \yvec\)</span> is expensive. Working with <span class="process-math">\(X^\transpose \yvec\)</span> is comparatively much less computationally intensive.</div>
