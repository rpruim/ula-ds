<div class="para">Our first task is to assess the similarity between various Wikipedia articles by forming vectors from each of five articles.  In particular, one may download the text from a Wikipedia article, remove common words, such as “the” and “and”, count the number of times the remaining words appear in the article, and represent these counts in a vector, called the <dfn class="terminology">document vector</dfn> for each article.</div>
<div class="para">For example, evaluate the following cell that loads a matrix constructed from the Wikipedia articles on Veteran’s Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, the Golden Globe Awards, and the Super Bowl.  Each row of the matrix represents one of 604 words and each column represents one of the articles as a document vector. For instance, the word “act” appears 3 times in the Veteran’s Day article and 0 times in the Labor Day article. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-python" id="sage-186"><script type="text/x-sage">import pandas as pd

<li><div class="para">Suppose that two articles have no words in common.  What is the value of the dot product between their corresponding vectors?  What does this say about the angle between these vectors?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose there are two articles on the same subject, yet one article is twice as long.  What approximate relationship would you expect to hold between the two vectors?  What does this say about the angle between them?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Use the Python cell below to find the angle between the document vector for the Veteran’s Day article and the other four articles.  To express the angle in degrees, multiply radians by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">180.0 / math.pi</code>. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-python" id="sage-187"><script type="text/x-sage">import numpy as np
