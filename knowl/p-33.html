<div class="para">Probably the simplest way to think about a vector is as an ordered list of numbers. This is how we will usually represent vectors in the computer. This is also what allows us to connect linear algebra to data. Suppose we have selling prices of 100 homes, for example. We could put those 100 numbers into an ordered list and call it a vector of home prices. That allows us to think about all 100 home prices together as one unit -- the selling price of (these particular 100) homes. This kind of vector can be called a <dfn class="terminology">variable vector</dfn> since in contains all the information about one variable (in this case price). A richer data set could have many variables, each one stored as a vector. </div>
