<div class="para">In scenes were some regions are very bright and others very dark, it can be challenging to create a good exposure over the entire image. Exposure bracketing is a technique that has been used since the 1850’s to help with this situation. This technique involves capturing multiple images, each with a different exposure. Later one can choose the best of the captured images or combine them in some way.  In the 1850’s, Gustave Le Gray printed seascape photos from two images, using one exposure for the sky and the other for the water. Modern HDR methods can combine multiple digital images in much more complex ways.</div>
