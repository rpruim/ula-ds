<div class="para">The mathematical perspective.</div>
<div class="para">The mathematical perspetive is a little bit different again. From this perspective, what is important are the properties that vectors have, and anything sharing these properties (arrows, lists of numbers, or something else entirely) can be considered a vector. Actually, we don’t think about individual vectors so much as a collection of vectors, called a <dfn class="terminology">vector space</dfn>. For each positive integer <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\)</span> is an example of a vector space. Indeed, those will be the vector spaces of primary concern in data science. But there are many other vector spaces. </div>
<div class="para">Vector spaces allow for two important operations: <dfn class="terminology">scalar multiplication</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">vector addition</dfn>, and these operations must satisfy a few basic properties for the vectors to be considered a vector space. "Scalar" is just a fancy word for a number. In scalar multiplication, we multiply a scalar (number) and a vector . The result is a vector (in the same vector space). For vector addition, we add two vectors and obtain another vector (in the same vector space).</div>
<div class="para">Before enumerating the properties these operations must have, let’s define these operations using the data and geometric perspectives.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-vectors.html#li-9" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
