<div class="para">Googleâ€™s big idea was to use the structure of the Internet to assess the quality of web pages without any human intervention.  For instance, if a web page has quality content, it is likely that other web pages will link to it.  This means that the number of links to a page should reflect the quality of that page.  In addition, we would expect a page to have even higher quality content if those links are coming from pages that are themselves assessed to have high quality.  Simply said, if many quality pages link to a page, that is an indication that the page itself is probably of high quality.  This is the essence of the PageRank algorithm, which we introduce in the next activity.</div>
