<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are three ways we can think about vectors, and each one will play a role in our study of linear algebra.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<div class="para">The data/computer science perspective.</div>
<div class="para">Probably the simplest way to think about a vector is as an ordered list of numbers. This is how we will usually represent vectors in the computer. This is also what allows us to connect linear algebra to data. Suppose we have selling prices of 100 homes, for example. We could put those 100 numbers into an ordered list and call it a vector of home prices. That allows us to think about all 100 home prices together as one unit -- the selling price of (these particular 100) homes. This kind of vector can be called a <dfn class="terminology">variable vector</dfn> since in contains all the information about one variable (in this case price). A richer data set could have many variables, each one stored as a vector. </div>
<div class="para">Alternatively, we may consider a single home and record several different pieces of information about it (selling price, number of bedrooms, size of the lot, etc.). All the information about one home can be stored as a vector. This kind of variable can be called a <dfn class="terminology">sample vector</dfn> or a <dfn class="terminology">case vector</dfn>, since the vector represents one observational unit. A large data set will consist of many case vectors. </div>
<div class="para">When working with data, our list of numbers might be very long. We could have hundreds, or thousands, or millions, or more cases or variables that we are keeping track of. The good news is that vectors behave the same way no matter how long the list of numbers. This means we can learn a lot from smaller examples, which are easier to work with (and visualize).</div>
<div class="para">So let’s consider some smaller examples. <span class="process-math">\(\vvec = \left[
\begin{array}{r}
2 \\
1 \\
\end{array}
\right]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\wvec = \left[
\begin{array}{r}
-3 \\
1 \\
0 \\
2 \\
\end{array}
\right]\)</span> are both vectors. The entries in a vector are called its <dfn class="terminology">components</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">entries</dfn>.  Since the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\)</span> has two components, we say that it is a two-dimensional vector; in the same way, the vector <span class="process-math">\(\wvec\)</span> is a four-dimensional vector.</div>
<div class="para">Because the numbers we are using are "real" numbers (numbers of any size that can be represented as fractions or decimals), we will denote the set of all <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>-dimensional vectors by <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, if <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is a 3-dimensional vector, we say that <span class="process-math">\(\uvec\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\)</span> (written <span class="process-math">\(\uvec \in
\real^3\)</span>). Note that this will require us to recode non-numeric data using numbers. </div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">The physics/geometry perspective.</div>
<div class="para">This perpective helps us "see" linear algebra. From this perspective, a vector is something that has <dfn class="terminology">magnitude</dfn> (length) and <dfn class="terminology">direction</dfn>. In 2 or 3 dimensions (actually, in 1 dimension as well), vectors can eaily be visualized as arrows. Figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-vector-0.html" title="Figure 1.1.1">Figure 1.1.1</a> shows an example in 2 dimensions.</div>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:25%;margin-right:25%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="external/images/vector-u.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A graphical representation of the vector in 2 dimensions.</figcaption></figure><div class="para">If you are familar with this perspecitve -- perhaps from physics where it is used frequently to describe position, velocity, force, etc. -- note that in linear algebra it is almost always the case that all vectors (arrows) will begin at the same position, called the <dfn class="terminology">origin</dfn>. </div>
<div class="para">The geometric and data prespectives are linked using <dfn class="terminology">Cartesian coordinates</dfn>. If you look back at Figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-vector-0.html" title="Figure 1.1.1">Figure 1.1.1</a>, you can see that we have placed a grid in the background. This makes it easy to see that our vector stretches 2 units in the horizontal (or x) direction and 1 unit in the vertical (y) direction. So Figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-vector-0.html" title="Figure 1.1.1">Figure 1.1.1</a> is a representation of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vvec = \twovec 21\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Any vector in <span class="process-math">\(\real^1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\real^2\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\)</span> can be represented in a similar way. Vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\real^1\)</span> live on a line, vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\real^2\)</span> live on a plane, and vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\)</span> live in 3-d "space", which we can represent reasonably well with perspective drawings in the plane. Beyond three diminsions, its more difficult to visualize vectors, but we will use the intuitions we develop in low dimension to help us understand what is happening in higher dimensions.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">The mathematical perspective.</div>
<div class="para">The mathematical perspetive is a little bit different again. From this perspective, what is important are the properties that vectors have, and anything sharing these properties (arrows, lists of numbers, or something else entirely) can be considered a vector. Actually, we don’t think about individual vectors so much as a collection of vectors, called a <dfn class="terminology">vector space</dfn>. For each positive integer <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\)</span> is an example of a vector space. Indeed, those will be the vector spaces of primary concern in data science. But there are many other vector spaces. </div>
<div class="para">Vector spaces allow for two important operations: <dfn class="terminology">scalar multiplication</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">vector addition</dfn>, and these operations must satisfy a few basic properties for the vectors to be considered a vector space. "Scalar" is just a fancy word for a number. In scalar multiplication, we multiply a scalar (number) and a vector . The result is a vector (in the same vector space). For vector addition, we add two vectors and obtain another vector (in the same vector space). </div>
<div class="para">Before enumerating the properties these operations must have, let’s define these operations using the data and geometric perspectives.</div>
