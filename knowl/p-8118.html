<div class="para">Of course, this is a contrived example.  Typically, the presence of noise in a dataset means that we do not expect all the points to be wholly contained in a smaller dimensional subspace. One situation where this does occur, however, is when some of the variables in the data set are computed as linear combinations of other variables. This could happen, for example, if our data had measurements in two different units (say, Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures) or if the data included both subtotals and totals in a sum (e.g., before tax bill, tax, and total with tax included). </div>
