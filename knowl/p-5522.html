<div class="para">In this section, we introduce a new operation on vectors, known as the <dfn class="terminology">dot product</dfn>. Geometrically, the dot product is related to the lengths of vectors and the angles between pairs of vectors. Importantly, the dot product is also easily computed from the list-of-numbers representation of vectors. It also has many nice algebraic properties. So this is another situation where each of our three presepectives of vectors provides valuable insight.</div>
