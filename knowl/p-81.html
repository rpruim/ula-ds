<li><div class="para">We can think of vectors in three different ways: (1) as a list of numbers (the data perspective); (2) as magnitude and direction, i.e., arrows (the geomtric perspective), or (3) as a set of objects with certain properties (the mathematical perspective). The ability to move betwen these three ways of thinking is one of the keys to understanding linear algebra.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We are primarily interested in <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\text{,}\)</span> the space of vectors consisting of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> real numbers in the data perspective. But there are many other vector spaces.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There are two operations we can perform with vectors: scalar multiplication and vector addition. Both of these operations are easily computed from a list of numbers but also have geometric meaning.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Euclidean <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> (or norm) of a vector can be computed using the Pythagorean. The square of length is the sum of the squares of the vectorâ€™s components.</div></li>
