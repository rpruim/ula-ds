The second most similar article is Labor Day, which is also a national holiday.  The other two are quite dissimilar as they are entertainment events.</div></li>

<div class="para">Correlation matrices are square and have a row and column for each of the vectors we computed correlations with.  Since we have 4 column vectors here, we get a <span class="process-math">\(4 \by 4\)</span> matrix. It would be <span class="process-math">\(10 \by 10\)</span> if we did row-wise correlations. These matrices are always symmetric because the definition of correlation is symmetric. The diagonal entries are 1 because</div>
