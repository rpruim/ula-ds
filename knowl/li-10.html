</h2>
<div class="para">The traditional approach begins with a computational form and links this to geometry using the Law of Cosines, a result that is unfamiliar to many students.  The result is that the computational and geometric forms can seem unrelated, and projections can feel a bit mysterious.</div>
<div class="para">Here we motivate dot products from a desire to compute projections and establish the connection to the computational formala without citing the Law of Cosines. Our hope is that this will make  these topics feel more natural and intuitive.  In the end, we will end in the same place, relying on the important interplay between three ways of thinking: data-centric, geometric, and mathematical.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-2.html#li-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
