## Chapter 1

* Gaussion Elimination Activity --  For each of the **following linear systems**, use Gaussian elimination to describe the solutions to the **following systems of linear equations**.

## Chapter 2

* "should be not be expressible"

## Chapter 3

* Error in solution 3.5.4e: extraneous $-2$ should be 0 in last vector.

## Chapter 4

* Def of probability vector in summary refers to "columns".  "Entries" would be better here.

## Chapter 5

* The term orhtogonal least squares is usually used for something different.  What is presented here is *ordinary* least squares. In orthogonal least squares, the error terms are othogonal to the line instead of vertical.

## Chapter 7

* Example 7.1.6: both eigen vectors are named $\vec{u}_1$.

* Activity 7.3.3: 

    * Sage Cell fails to evaluate -- Sage deprecation issues perhaps?
    * Question mark where period is better (Then determine...)
    
* Activity 7.3.4

    * I recommend giving data sets meaningful names (not `df`). This makes it easier
    to recall what the data are and exemplifies good coding behavior when working with data.
    
* Sentence after Prop 7.4.6 is missing the word "as".

* I'm curious why you transpose data matrices for display. From a statistics point of view, that is an unnatural way to look at data, and on my computer, it is almost illegible:

* The example using SVD to compress an image would be more interesting with a more interesting image.  Here is an example: <https://rpruim.github.io/ds303/S20/from-class/svd/svd.html>
