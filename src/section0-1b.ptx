    Vectors in Python
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we have been introduced to vectors, it's time to learn how  
      to work with vectors in Python.  
    </p>

    <title> Introduction to Python </title>
    
    <p>
      SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. 
	  It builds on top of many existing open-source packages: 
	  NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more. 
	  Access their combined power through a common, Python-based language or directly via 
	  interfaces or wrappers. 

	  In this book we will use SageMath as a way to embed Python (and sometimes R) cells 
	  that you can edit and execute as you learn linear algebra.
	</p>

	    <p> Here is a Python cell containing a command
	    that asks Python to multiply 5 and 3.  You may execute the
	    command by pressing the <em>Evaluate</em> button.
	    
	    <sage language="python">
	      <input>
		5 * 3
	      </input>
	    </sage>

		Of course, you can run this sort of Python code in other Python 
		environments as well, including in a Jupyter notebook, in an RMarkdown
		or Quarto document, in posit RStudio, in a Sage cell server, etc.
		The Python cells in this text provide a handy way to try things out as 
		you are reading, but you should adopt one of these other platforms for 
		saving work.
	    </p>


    <p>
      Throughout the text, we will introduce new Python commands that
      allow us to explore linear algebra concepts.  These commands
      are collected and summarized in the reference found in <xref
      ref="app-python-reference" text="custom"> Appendix A</xref>.

      <statement>
	<p>
	  <ol marker="a.">
	    <li>
	      <p> Python uses the standard operators <c>+</c>, <c>-</c>, <c>*</c>, and <c>/</c> for the usual
		  arithmetic operations.  <c>**</c> is used for exponentiation.
		  By entering text in the cell below, ask Python to evaluate
	      <me>
		3 + 4(2^4 - 1)
	      </me>

	    <li>
	      <p>
		Notice that we can create new lines by pressing
		<em>Enter</em> and entering additional commands on
		them. 	What happens when you evaluate this cell?
		<sage language="python">
		  <input>
		    5 * 3
		    10 - 4
		  </input>
		</sage>
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		Notice that we don't see any output from the cell we just evaluated.
    In order to see the results, we use <c>print()</c>:

		<sage language="python">
		  <input>
		    print(5 * 3)
		    print(10 - 4)
		  </input>
		</sage>
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>
	      <p> We may give a name to the result of one command and
	      refer to it in a later command.
	      <sage language="python">
		<input>
		  income = 1500 * 12
		  taxes = income * 0.15
		  print(income - taxes)
		</input>
	      </sage>
	      </p>
	      
	      <p> Suppose you have three tests in your linear algebra
	      class and your scores are 90, 100, and 98.  In the cell
	      below, add your scores together and call the result
	      <c>total</c>.  On the next line, find the average of your
	      test scores and print it.

      <p> Since a vector is just a list of numbers, if you know Python, you might expect that we
        will create vectors using Python lists. This is partially correct. But Python lists don't
        know about our operations (scalar multiplication and vector addition). In order to get
        vectors that know about these operations, we will convert our Python lists into <term>
        ndarrays</term> (n-dimensional arrays) using the Python package <c>numpy</c>. </p>

      <p> Python can perform scalar multiplication and vector addition. We define a vector using 
      <c>np.array()</c>; then <c>*</c> and <c>+</c> denote scalar multiplication and vector addition. 
        <sage
          language="python">
          <input>
import numpy as np
v = np.array([3,1])
w = np.array([-1,2])
print(type(v))
print (2*v)
print (v + w)
          </input>
        </sage>
      </p>

      <idx> shape </idx>

	<note>
	  <title>Numpy</title>
	  <p>
	  Numpy is a python module that is heavily used in data science. <c>import numpy as np</c> 
	  loads this module and declares that we will refer to it as <c>np</c> in subsequent code.
	  Vectors are created using <c>np.array()</c>, which is provided with a list of numbers.
	  </p>

	  <p>Using <c>np.array()</c> is better than just using a generic Python list, however, because 
	  numpy provides tools to perform all sorts of useful computations with vectors (and matrices), 
    as we shall see.</p>
	</note>

      <remark> numpy uses the term <em>dimension</em> differently from how we have been using it. In
        numpy parlance, all of the vectors we have seen are 1-dimensional arrays because there is
        just one column of numbers. This will make more sense when we see 2-dimensional arrays
        (matrices) and higher dimensional arrays (tensors). We can use <c>.shape</c> to find out how
        many components are in one of our vectors. Give it a try. Type <c>print(v.shape)</c> in the
        code block above and re-evaluate. </remark>

      <p>
        For low dimensional vectors, manually typing in each component is reasonable.  But ofen we will  
        work with vectors with many components.  So we will need some better ways to create these  
        vectors. Here are some examples showing how to create structured or random vectors.
        <sage
          language="python">
          <input>
import numpy as np
v = np.array(range(100))
# 5 to 100 by 5's -- note the 101 here!
w = np.array(range(5, 101, 5))  
print(v.shape)
print(v)
print(w)
r = np.random.normal(100, 10, 50)
print(r.shape)
print(r)
          </input>
        </sage>
      </p>

      <p>
        Once we have an ndarray, we can compute various summaries of it.
        The mean and standard deviation are two common examples.
        <sage
          language="python">
          <input>
import numpy as np
r = np.random.normal(100, 10, 50)
print("shape:", r.shape, "mean:", r.mean().round(2), "sd:", r.std().round(2))
          </input>
        </sage>
      </p>
