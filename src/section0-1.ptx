    Vectors

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Scalars, vectors, and matrices will play an inportant part in using
      linear algebra in data science, so it will be good for us to become
      acquainted with them and how to work with them in Python. This section
      will focus on scalars and vectors. Section <xref ref="sec-matrices"/> 
      will focus on matrices.

  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>
      Three ways to think about vectors
    </title> There are three ways we can think about
    vectors, and each one will play a role in our study of linear algebra. <ol>

      <li>
        <p>
          The data/computer science perspective.
        </p>
        <p> Probably the simplest way
          to think about a vector is as an ordered list of numbers.
          This is how we will usually represent vectors in the computer, and this is what allows us
    to connect linear algebra to data. Suppose we
          have selling prices of 100 homes, for example. We could put those 100
          numbers into an ordered list and call it a vector of home prices.
          That allows us to think about all 100 home prices together as one unit --
          the selling price of (these particular 100) homes.
        </p>

        <p>
          When working with data, our list of numbers might be very long. We
          could have hundreds, or thousands, or millions, or more instances that
          we are keeping track of. The good news is that vectors behave the same
          way no matter how long the list of numbers. This means we can learn a
          lot from smaller examples, which are easier to work with (and
          visualize).
        </p>

        <idx> component </idx>
        <idx> dimension </idx>

        <p> So let's consider some smaller examples. <m>
            \vvec = \left[
            \begin{array}{r}
            2 \\
            1 \\
            \end{array}
            \right]
          </m>
    and <m>
            \wvec = \left[
            \begin{array}{r}
            -3 \\
            1 \\
            0 \\
            2 \\
            \end{array}
            \right]
          </m>
    are both vectors. The entries in a vector are called its <term>components</term>. Since the
    vector <m>\vvec</m> has two components, we say that it is a two-dimensional vector; in the same
    way, the vector <m>\wvec</m> is a four-dimensional vector. </p>

        <p> Because the numbers we are using are "real" numbers (numbers of any size that can be
    represented as fractions or decimals -- possibly with infinitely many digits after the decimal
    point), we will denote the set of all <m>
            m</m>-dimensional vectors by <m>\real^m</m>. Consequently, if <m>\uvec</m> is a
    3-dimensional vector, we say that <m>\uvec</m> is in <m>\real^3</m> (written <m>\uvec \in
            \real^3</m>). </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The physics/geometry perspective.
        </p>
        <p> This perpective helps us "see" linear algebra. From this perspective, a vector is
    something that has <term>magnitude</term> (length) and <term>direction</term>. In 2 or 3
    dimensions (actually, in 1 dimension as well), vectors can eaily be visualized as arrows. Figure <xref
            ref="fig-vector-0" /> shows an example in 2 dimensions. <figure xml:id="fig-vector-0">
            <caption>
              A graphical representation of the vector in 2 dimensions.
            </caption>
            <sidebyside width="50%">
              <image source="images/vector-u" />
            </sidebyside>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <idx>origin</idx>
        <p> If you are familar with this perspecitve -- perhaps from physics where it is used
    frequently to describe position, velocity, force, etc. -- note that in linear algebra it is
    almost always the case that all vectors (arrows) will begin at the same position, called the <term>
    origin</term>. </p>

        <p> The geometric and data prespectives are linked using <term>Cartesian
            coordinates</term>. If you look back at Figure <xref
            ref="fig-vector-0" />, you can see that we have placed a grid in the background. This
    makes it easy to see that our vector stretches 2 units in the horizontal (or x) direction and 1
    unit in the vertical (y) direction. So Figure <xref ref="fig-vector-0" /> is a representation of
    the vector <m>\vvec = \twovec 21</m>. </p>

        <p> Any vector in <m>\real^1</m>, <m>\real^2</m>, or <m>
            \real^3</m> can be represented in a similar way. Vectors in <m>\real^1</m> live on a
    line, vectors in <m>\real^2</m> live on a plane, and vectors in <m>\real^3</m> live in 3-d
    "space", which we can represent reasonably well with perspective drawings in the plane. Beyond
    three diminsions, its more difficult to visualize vectors, but we will use the intuitions we
    develop in low dimension to help us understand what is happening in higher dimensions. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The mathematical perspective.
        </p>

        <p> The mathematical perspetive is a little bit different again. From this perspective, what
    is important are the properties that vectors have, and anything sharing these properties
    (arrows, lists of numbers, or something else entirely) can be considered a vector. Actually, we
    don't think about individual vectors so much as a collection of vectors, called a <term>vector
    space</term>. For each positive integer <m>m</m>, <m>\real^m</m> is an example of a vector
    space. Indeed, those will be the vector spaces of primary concern in data science. But there are
    many other vector spaces. </p>

        <idx> scalar </idx>
        <p> Vector spaces allow for two important operations: <term>scalar multiplication</term> and <term>vector
    addition</term>, and these operations must satisfy a few basic properties for the vectors to be
    considered a vector space. "Scalar" is just a fancy word for a number. In scalar multiplication,
    we multiply a scalar (number) and a vector . The result is a vector (in the same vector space).
    For vector addition, we add two vectors and obtain another vector (in the same vector space). </p>

        <p>
          Before enumerating the properties these operations must have, let's define these
          operations
          using the data and geometric perspectives.
        </p>

      </li>

      Vector operations: scalar multiplication and vector addition.
    </title>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-scalar-multiplication">
      <title>Scalar Multiplication</title>


      <p> Let's begin with the data perspective. In this perspective a vector is just a list of
        numbers like <m>\vvec = \twovec 21</m>. To multiply <m> \vvec </m> by the scalar <m> s = 3</m>,
        we simply multiply each component by 3. So <m> 3 \vvec = 3 \twovec 21 = \twovec{6}{3}</m>.
        The same thing works for any vector and any scalar -- we simply multiply each component of
        the vector by the scalar to get a new list of numbers. </p>

      <p> Now consider what happens to the arrow representing <m>\vvec = \twovec 21</m> when we
        multiply by the scalar <m>s=3</m>. Each component of the vector will be three times as
        large, so the vector will stretch three times as far horizontally and also three times as
        far vertically. In other words, the vector will be three times as long, but still point in
        the same direction as <m>\vvec</m>. See Figure <xref ref="fig-scalar-mult-0" />. This
        explains the name "scalar" multiplication: This type of multiplication rescales the vector.
        Note that if the scalar is negative, then the arrow will point in the oposite direction. <figure
          width="50%" xml:id="fig-scalar-mult-0">
          <caption>Scalar multiplication "scales" a vector by stretching or shrinking it. If the
        scalar is positive, then the scalar product will point in the same direction as <m>\vvec</m>.
        If the scalar is negative, then the scalar product will point in the opposite direction.</caption>

    <remark>
      <title>A note on notation</title>

      <p>
        It is important to be able to distinguish vectors from scalars.
      You may have noticed that we have been using bold (lower case) letters to represent 
      vectors.  This will be our standard notation to help us distinguish vectors from 
      scalars, which we will not put inbold.
      </p>
      <p>
      You may have seen other notation for vectors, including 
      notation that places a small arrow above variables representing vectors. That notation 
      works poorly in statistical contexts where that space is often used for other things 
      (e.g., <m>\hat{\xvec}, \overline{\xvec}, \tilde{\xvec}, \dots</m>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing by hand, bold is tricky.  We suggest placing a "wiggle" below letters  
        that would be typeset in bold.
      </p>
    </remark>


    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-vector-addition">
      <title>Vector addition</title>

      <p> From the data perspective, vector addition works <term>componentwise</term>. That is, we
        obtain the sum by adding corresponding values in the two vectors. For example <me>
        \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -4 \\ 3 \\ \end{array}\right]
          +
          \left[\begin{array}{r} -5 \\ 6 \\ -3 \\ \end{array}\right]
          =
          \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 - 5 \\ -4 + 6 \\ 3 - 3 \\ \end{array}\right]
          =
          \left[\begin{array}{r} -3 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ \end{array}\right].
        </me>
        For this operation to make sense, it is important that <em>both vectors
          have the same number of components</em> (i.e., that they live in the same vector space).
        In our example, the vectors are in <m>\real^3</m>. </p>

      <p> To represent the sum <m>\vvec + \wvec</m> geometrically, we imagine walking from the
        origin for distance and direction specified by <m>\vvec</m>. From there, we continue our
        walk using the distance and direction prescribed by <m>\wvec</m>, after which we arrive at
        the sum <m>\vvec + \wvec</m>. This is illustrated on the left of <xref ref="fig-vector-sum" />
        where the tail of <m>\wvec</m> is placed on the tip of <m>\vvec</m>. <figure
          xml:id="fig-vector-sum">
          <sidebyside widths="45% 45%">
            <image source="images/vector-addition-a" />
            <image source="images/vector-addition" />
          </sidebyside>
          <caption> Vector addition as a simple walk in the plane is
            illustrated on the left. The vector sum is represented as the
            diagonal of a parallelogram on the right.
          </caption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <idx>commutative</idx>
      <p> Alternatively, we may construct the parallelogram with <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> as
        two sides. The sum is then the diagonal of the parallelogram, as illustrated on the right of <xref
          ref="fig-vector-sum" />. Just as was the case for the list of numbers approach, it doesn't
        matter which vector comes first and which second, we end up in the same place either way.
        That is <m>\vvec + \wvec = \wvec + \vvec</m> for any vectors <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m>
        that live in the same vector space. If you like fancy words, you can say that vector
        addition is <term>commutative</term>. </p>

      <p> If you worked through the activty above, you should have discovered that the set of
        vectors having the form <m>c\vvec</m> is a line through the origin. To form the set of
        vectors <m>c\vvec+\wvec</m>, we can begin with the vector <m>\wvec</m> and add multiples of <m>
        \vvec</m>. Geometrically, this means that we begin from the tip of <m>\wvec</m> and move in
        a direction parallel to <m>\vvec</m>. The effect is to translate the line <m> c\vvec</m> by
        the vector <m>\wvec</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-parametric-line" />. <figure
          xml:id="fig-parametric-line">

        </figure>
      </p>
      <p> At times, it will be useful for us to think of vectors and points interchangeably. That
        is, we may wish to think of the vector <m>\left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]</m>
        as describing the point <m>(2,1)</m> and vice-versa. When we say that the vectors having the
        form <m>c\vvec + \wvec</m> form a line, we really mean that the tips of the vectors all lie
        on the line passing through <m>\wvec</m> and parallel to <m>\vvec</m>. When thinking about
        many (possibly infinitely many) vectors, it is often easier to visualize them as points
        rather than as arrows. </p>

      <p> These are exactly the properties that define a vector space mathematically. For scalars we
        can use any <term>field</term> (think: a number system where addition, subtraction,
        mulitiplication, and division are defined and have the properites you are familiar with from
        the real numbers). The vectors can be anything as long as the operations satisfies the 8
        properties listed above. </p>

    <title>Summary</title>

        <p>
          We can think of vectors in three different ways: 
          (1) as a list of numbers (the data perspective);
          (2) as magnitude and direction, i.e., arrows (the geomtric perspective),
          or (3) as a set of objects with certain properties (the mathematical perspective).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>
        We are primarily interested in <m>\real^m</m>, the space of vectors consisting 
        of <m>m</m> real numbers in the data perspective. But there are many other 
        vector spaces.
        </p>
      </li>
        <li>
          <p> There are two operations we can perform with vectors:
            scalar multiplication and vector addition. Both of these
            operations are easily computed from a list of numbers but also have 
            geometric meaning.</p>
