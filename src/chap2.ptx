  <title>Vectors, matrices, and linear combinations</title>

  <introduction>
  <p> We began our study of linear systems in <xref ref="chap1" /> where
  we described linear systems in terms of augmented matrices, such as
  <me>
    \left[
    \begin{array}{rrr|r}
    1 \amp 2 \amp -1 \amp 3 \\
    -3 \amp 3 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
    2 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp -1 \\
    \end{array}
    \right]
  </me>
  In this chapter, we will uncover geometric information in a matrix
  like this, which will lead to an intuitive understanding of the
  insights we previously gained into the solutions of linear systems.
