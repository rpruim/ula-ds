<introduction>
    <definition>
      <idx> linear combination </idx>
      <idx> weights </idx>
      <p> The <term> linear combination </term> of the vectors <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m>
        with scalars <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n</m> is the vector <me>
          c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 + \ldots + c_n\vvec_n\text{.}
        </me> The scalars <m>
        c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n</m> are called the <term>weights</term> of the linear combination. </p>
    </definition>

    <remark>If you have seen linear models, then this should look familiar to you. A linear model
      can be expressed as a linear combination of data variables. We typically use <m>\beta_0,
      \beta_1, \dots, \beta_k</m> to denote the scalars, which are the parameters of the linear
      model. And we write the data variabels as <m>\xvec_1, \xvec_2, \dots, \xvec_k</m>. So our
      linear model looks like <me>
        \E(\yvec) = \beta_0 \onevec + \beta_1 \xvec_1 + \beta_2 \xvec_2 + \cdots + \beta_k \xvec_k
      \; .
      </me>
      And the fitted model as <me>
        \hat{\yvec} = \hat{\beta}_0 \onevec + \hat{\beta}_1 \xvec_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 \xvec_2 + \cdots
      + \hat{\beta_k} \xvec_k \; .
      </me>

        <p> In this activity, we will look at linear combinations of a pair of vectors, <m>
            \vvec = \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]
          </m> and <m>
          \wvec = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]

            <li>
              <p> When we vary <m>c</m> with <m>d=0</m>, the linear combination moves along the line
                defined by <m>\vvec</m>. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> When <m>d=1</m> and <m>c</m> is allowed to vary, the linear combinations lie on
                the line through <m>\wvec</m> parallel to <m>\vvec</m>. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> If the weights <m>c=0</m> and <m>d=0</m>, then the linear combination is the
                vector <m>\twovec{0}{0}</m>. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> If the weights <m>c=2</m> and <m>d=-1</m>, then the linear combination is the
                vector <m>\twovec{3}{0}</m>. You could determine this by a little trial and error,
                or using a little algebra. <m>c \vvec + d \wvec = \twovec 30</m> is equivalent to 
                <me>

                We will learn general methods for solving systems of equations like this soon.
                But in this case, the second equation tells us that <m>c = -2d</m>.  Plugging 
                that into the first equation gives <m>-4d + d = -3d = 3</m>, so <m>d = -1</m> and 
                <m>c = 2</m>.

            <li>
              <p> 
                Our two systems of equations are 
                <me>
                  \begin{alignedat}{3}
                  2c \amp {}+{} \amp 1d \amp {}={} \amp 1.3 \\
                  1c \amp {}+{} \amp 2d \amp {}={} \amp -1.7 \\
                  \end{alignedat}
                </me>
                and
                <me>
                  \begin{alignedat}{3}
                  2c \amp {}+{} \amp 1d \amp {}={} \amp 15.2 \\
                  1c \amp {}+{} \amp 2d \amp {}={} \amp 7.1 \\
                  \end{alignedat}
                </me>
                We don't have a 0 on the right hand side this time, so the algebra 
                is a little messier.  But both systems have a solution.
                Stay tuned to learn how to systematically solve such systems.

            <li>
              <p> Every two-dimensional vector can be written as a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m>
                and <m>\wvec</m>.  The number <m>c</m> chooses a line parallel to <m>\wvec</m>, and 
                <m>d</m> chooses a point along that line.  Since we can pick any line parallel to 
                <m>\wvec</m> and any point along that line, this allows us to get to any point in the plane. 
                Use the interactive app above to illustrate this. Note that this only works because  
                <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> are not parllel.

                <p>
                We will soon learn an algebraic way to arrive at the same conclusion.

    <p> This activity illustrates how linear combinations are constructed geometrically: the linear
      combination <m>c\vvec +
        d\wvec</m> is found by walking along <m>\vvec</m> a total of <m>c</m> times followed by
      walking along <m>\wvec</m> a total of <m>d</m> times. When one of the weights is held constant
      while the other varies, the vector moves along a line. </p>

    <example xml:id="example-linear-systems-preview">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have vectors <m>\vvec = \twovec3{-1}</m> and 
          <m>\wvec=\twovec43</m>. Suppose we want to know whether we can describe the vector 
          <m>\bvec=\twovec{-11}{-18}</m> as a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m>. In
          other words, we would like to know whether there are weights <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> such
          that <me>
            c\vvec + d\wvec= \bvec.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p> This leads to the equations <me>
            \begin{aligned}

        </p>
        <p> Equating the components of the vectors on each side of the equation, we arrive at the

          This means that <m>\bvec</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> if
          and only if this <term>linear system</term> of equations has a solution.

      </statement>
    </example>

    <p> <xref ref="example-linear-systems-preview"/> demonstrates a connection between 
      linear combinations of vectors and linear systems of equations:
      Asking whether a vector <m>\bvec</m> is a linear combination of vectors <m>
      \vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is equivalent to asking whether an associated 
      <term>linear system</term> has a solution. 
      In <xref ref="chap2"/> we will study linear systems more carefully, giving a careful  
      definition and demonstrating how we can determine the solutions to any such system of  
      equations.

        <p> These vectors appear to lie on the same line, a fact that becomes apparent once we

            c\vvec + d\wvec

          the <m>\vvec</m> direction and <m>d</m> times in the <m>\wvec</m> direction. With these
          vectors, we are always walking along the same line so it would seem that any linear
          combination of these vectors should lie on the same line. In addition, a vector that is
          not on the line, say <m>\bvec
            = \twovec30</m>, should not be expressible as a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m>

          This shows that the associated linear system is inconsistent, which means that the vector <m>
          \bvec=\twovec30</m> cannot be written as a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m>
          . </p>

          </me>
          tells us to expect this. Since there is not a pivot position in the second row of the
          coefficient matrix <m>\begin{bmatrix}\vvec
            \amp \wvec \end{bmatrix}</m>, it is possible for a pivot position to appear in the
          rightmost column of the augmented matrix <me>
            \left[
            \begin{array}{rr|r} \vvec \amp \wvec \amp \bvec \end{array}

      Summary
    </title>

    <p> This section has introduced linear combinations of vectors 
    and their connection to linear systems. <ul>

        <li>
          <p> Given a set of vectors and a set of scalars we call
            weights, we can create a linear combination using scalar
            multiplication and vector addition. </p>
        </li>

        <li>To know whether one vector can be formed as a linear 
        combination of some other vectors is equivalent to solving 
        a (linear) system of equations.
        </li>

        We will learn more about both linear combinations and linear systems 
        in what follows.
      </ul>
