      <ol marker="a.">
	<li> <p> If the vectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> form

	<li><p>
	  Suppose that <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is a

	  the linear independence or dependence of a subset of these
	  vectors?

	<li><p> Suppose <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is a

	inconsistent, what can you say about the linear independence
	or dependence of the set of vectors

	<li><p>
	  Yes.  If <m>c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 = \zerovec</m> and one of the
	  weights is not zero, we can rearrange this expression to
	  solve for one of the vectors as a scalar multiple of the
	  other.  For instance, if <m>2\vvec_1-3\vvec_2=\zerovec</m>,
	  then <m>\vvec_1 = \frac32\vvec_2</m>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p>
	  Any subset of the vectors forms a linearly independent set.
	  Because the original set is linearly independent, none of
	  the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the
	  others.  This is still true when we look at a smaller set of
	  the vectors.

	<li><p>
	  The set of vectors
	  <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n,\bvec</m> will also be
	  linearly independent.  Since <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> is
	  inconsistent, we know that <m>\bvec</m> cannot be written as
	  a linear combination of the other vectors.  We also know
	  that each of the vectors <m>\vvec_j</m> cannot be written as
	  a linear combination of the others because
	  <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is a linearly

	<li><p>
	  True.  If we put the vectors into a matrix, there are more

	<li><p>
	  False.  They could form a linearly independent set, but we

	  True.  In this case, <m>\vvec_2</m> can be written as a

	<li><p>
	  True.  Since the vectors are linearly independent, <m>A</m>

      <p> When we explored matrix multiplication in <xref
      ref="sec-matrices-lin-combs" />, we saw that some properties
      that are true for real numbers are not true for matrices.  This
      exercise will investigate that in some more depth.

	  Suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two matrices and that
	  <m>AB = 0</m>.  If <m>B \neq 0</m>, what can you say about the
	linear independence of the columns of <m>A</m>? </p></li>

	<li><p> Suppose that we have matrices <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and
	<m>C</m> such that <m>AB = AC</m>.  We have seen that we
	cannot generally conclude that <m>B=C</m>.  If we assume
	additionally that 
	<m>A</m> is a matrix whose columns are linearly independent,
	explain why <m>B = C</m>.  You may wish to begin by rewriting
	the equation <m>AB = AC</m> as <m>AB-AC = A(B-C) = 0</m>.

	<li><p>
	  Since <m>B\neq0</m>, there is a column of <m>B</m>, which
	  we'll call <m>\xvec</m>, that is
	  not zero.  Since <m>AB = 0</m>, we know that <m>A\xvec =
	  \zerovec</m>, which means that <m>\xvec</m> is a nonzero
	  solution to the homogenous equation <m>A\xvec =
	  \zerovec</m>.  Therefore, the columns of <m>A</m> are
	  linearly dependent.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li><p>
	  Since the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent,
	  the only solution to the homogeneous equation
	  <m>A\xvec=\zerovec</m> is <m>\xvec=\zerovec</m>.  Since
	  that <m>A(B-C) = 0</m>, every column <m>\xvec</m> of
	  <m>B-C</m> satisfies <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m>.  Therefore,
	  every column of <m>B-C</m> is the zero vector, which implies
	  that <m>B=C</m>.
