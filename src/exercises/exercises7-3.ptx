	In <xref ref="activity-pca-iris" />, we looked at a dataset
	consisting of four measurements of 150 irises.  These

	      The sepal length and petal width will also be below the

	This dataset is a bit different from others that we've looked
	at because the scale of the measurements is significantly
	different.  For instance, the measurements for the body mass
	are roughly 100 times as large as those for the culmen length.
	For this reason, we will standardize the data by first
	demeaning it, as usual, and then rescaling each measurement by
	the reciprocal of its standard deviation.  The result is
