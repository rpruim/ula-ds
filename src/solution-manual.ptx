	  This Solutions Manual for <pubtitle>Understanding Linear
	  Algebra for Data Science</pubtitle> is organized by section with each
	  exercise starting at the top of its own page.  This should
	  make it easy to extract only the solutions to certain
	  exercises.
        </p>

        <p permid="nXh">
          Please do not post this solutions manual publicly on the
          internet nor in any electronic form where it is available in
          full to students.  As much as possible, we aspire to keep
          this solutions manual as a resource for instructors only so
          that students get the full benefit of activities and
          exercises by engaging with them without looking at
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p permid="Ueq">
          By extracting individual pages from the <init>PDF</init>, it
          is fine to share solutions to individual activities or
          exercises via course management system software.  Please do
          not post these individual pages publicly on the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          These solutions are derived in part from a set of solutions to 
          <pubtitle>Understanding Linear Algebra</pubtitle> by David Austin.
