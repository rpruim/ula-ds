	<title> Tensors </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			As we have seen, <c>numpy</c> treats vectors and matrices as 1-dimensional 
			and 2-dimensional arrays (both created using <c>np.array()</c>). 
			While mathematically 2-dimensional arrays (i.e, matrices) are the most 
			important (and vectors can be treated like <m>n \by 1</m> matrices); 
			computationally, there is no reason we need to stop at rows 
			and columns. We could add additional dimensions.  Higher dimensional 
			arrays are often called <term>tensors</term>.
		<idx>tensor</idx>
		</p>

	<p>
		There are two primary reasons for taking some time to think about tensors here.
		First, there are some interesting applications that use tensors.  One example of  
		this is color images.  Recall that color images store a matrix of values 
		<em>for each color channel</em>. So we have 3 indices into this data: 
		vertical position (row), horizontal position (column), and color channel. 
		If we have many images, we could store them in a 4-dimensional array, using 
		the additional index to indicate which photo is which.
	</p>

	<p>
		The second reason to discuss tensors is that most of the <c>numpy</c> code that works with 
		vectors and matrices is designed to work with higher dimensional tensors as well. 
		Understanding this can help demistify how some of the <c>numpy</c> functions work.
	</p>
		
	</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-numpy-tensors">
	<title>Tensors in NumPy</title>

	<p>
		In order to use NumPy, we first load the <c>numpy</c> package. 
	</p>

	<sage language="python" auto-evaluate="yes">
		<input>
import numpy as np
		</input>
	</sage>

	<p>
		Let's create a small 3-dimensional tensor.  Notice that we can assign the shape 
		(as long as the product of the items in our tuple is equal to the number values 
		in the array).
	</p>
		
	<sage language="python">
	<input>
A = np.arange(4 * 3 * 2)
A.shape = (4, 3, 2)
print(A)
	</input>
	</sage>

	<p>
		Alternatively, we can use the <c>reshape</c> method of an array.
		<idx><c>reshape()</c></idx>
	</p>

	<sage language="python">
	<input>
A = np.arange(2 * 4 * 3).reshape(2, 4, 3)
print(A)
	</input>
	</sage>

	<p>
		The output above expresses <c>A</c> as two <m>4 \by 3</m> matrices, and we can separate out 
		those two matrices as <c>A[0]</c> and <c>A[1]</c>.  
	</p>

	<sage language="python">
	<input>
print(A[0])
	</input>
	</sage>


	<p>We can refer to individual numbers in an ndarray by providing the required number of indices.
	</p>
	<sage language="python">
	<input>
print(A[0,1,2])
	</input>
	</sage>

	<p>
		The indexing is more flexible than demonstrated above. In each slot we can provide a 
		<term>slice</term> of values. A slice has the format <c>start:stop:step</c>. If omitted,
		<c>start</c> is taken to be 0, <c>stop</c> is taken to be the length of the array in 
		that dimension, and <c>step</c> is taken to be 1.  To get all the values in some dimension,
		we can use <c>:</c>.  
	<idx> slice, of a matrix or tensor </idx>
	</p>

	<p>
		An interesting question is what the shape of the resulting array should be, and we have some control 
		over whether dimensions are dropped or not. Consider the following examples.
		<idx><h>axis</h><h>of an array or tensor</h></idx>
	</p>
	<sage language="python">
	<input>
print(A[:,:,1].shape)        # integer -> 2d
print(A[:,:,(1)].shape)      # tuple of length 1 -> 2d
print(A[:,:,1:2].shape)      # slice with one value -> 3d
print(A[:,:,[1]].shape)      # list of length 1 -> 3d
	</input>
	<output>
(2, 4)
(2, 4)
(2, 4, 1)
(2, 4, 1)
	</output>
	</sage>
	<p>
	The first two methods drop a dimension.  The latter two retain all three axes, even though one of them has only one 
	legal index (0). It is always important to know the shape of the arrays you are working with.  When in doubt, check.
	</p>


	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				An RGB image that is 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall 
				might correspond to a tensor with shape <c>(400, 300, 3)</c>. 
		Or perhaps <c>(3, 300, 400)</c>, or ... 
		The computer doesn't really care, but we need to know which slot is being used for what 
		in order to work with this image correctly.  The usual arrangement is row, column, channel.
		This is called the <term>channels-last convention</term>. But somtimes a channels-first 
		convention is used instead.
		<idx> channels-last convention </idx>
			</p>
			<p>
			  We can plot images (or other matrices that we would like to view as an image)	
			  using a number of different tools.  Here we demonstrate how to do so using 
			  <c>matplotlib</c>. <c>matplotlib</c> supports a variety of image formats. For RGB 
			  images, the RGB values can be integers from 0 to 255 or floating point 
			  values between 0 and 1.

			</p>
			
			  <sage language="python">
			  <input>
from skimage import io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
url = "https://rpruim.github.io/data/images/happy-dog.jpeg"
dog = io.imread(url)
print(dog.shape)
print(dog.dtype)
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(dog)
plt.show()
			  </input>
			  </sage>

			<p> Notice that <c>dog</c> contains a 3-dimensional array of unsiged 8-bit integers (0 -- 255) and 
			that the format is channels-last. We can plot individual channels in the same way.
			</p>
			<sage language="python">
				<input>
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(dog[:, :, 0])    # Red channel
plt.show()
				</input>
			</sage>
			<p>
				We've added a color bar to this image to show how matplotlib is mapping the values 0 to 255 to colors.
				Remember, this is the <em>red</em> channel. So a colormap that runs from dark blue to bright yellow  
				probably isn't the best choice.  We can use a scale of reds by setting <c>cmap="Reds"</c> 
				like this
			</p>
			<sage language="python">
				<input>
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(dog[:, :, 0], cmap = "Reds")    # Red channel
plt.show()
				</input>
			</sage>
			<p>
			If you use <c>cmap  = "Reds_r"</c> (give it a try), the order of the colors will be reversed and provide 
			a better visual representation (for human eyes -- it's the same data no matter what color scheme we  
			use for display).

	<subsection xml:id="subsec-axes">
		<title>Aggregation and Axes</title>

		<p>
			We have already discussed axes in the context of slices that do or do not drop axes.
			Aggregation (computing a value based on a subset of values in an n-dimensional array)
			is another place where axes are important.
		</p>

		<example>
			<title>Row and column sums</title>
			<p>
			We often want to know the sum or mean of all rows or columns of a matrix. NumPy provides two ways 
			to compute aggregating functions like this.
			</p>
			<sage language="python">
				<input>
A = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
print(A)
print("no axis specified: ", A.sum())
print("axis = 0:", A.sum(axis = 0))
print("axis = 1:", A.sum(axis = 1))
				</input>
				<output>
[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]]
no axis specified:  15
axis = 0: [3 5 7]
axis = 1: [ 3 12]
				</output>
			</sage>
			<p>
				Understanding the <c>axis</c> argument can be a little counterintuitive.
				Notice that to get row sums, we specify <c>axis = 1</c> and to get column 
				sums, we specify <c>axis = 0</c>.  Here's a way to think about this.
				Consider the shape of the result you want.  If we are computing row sums, then 
				our result should have two rows and one column, so <m>2 \by 1</m>. That is, 
				we have collapsed axis 1: <m>2 \by 3 \to 2 \by 1</m>.  The <c>axis</c> 
				argument specifies which axis (or axes) are being collapsed. And then, rather 
				than retaining these axes, 
				they are dropped (unless we specify <c>keepdims = True</c>).
			</p>
			
			<sage language="python">
				<input>
A = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
print("no axis specified: ", A.sum( keepdims = True))
print("axis = 0:\n", A.sum(axis = 0, keepdims = True))
print("axis = 1:\n", A.sum(axis = 1, keepdims = True))
				</input>
				<output>
no axis specified:  [[15]]
axis = 0:
 [[3 5 7]]
axis = 1:
 [[ 3]
 [12]]
				</output>
			</sage>

			<p>
				This way of doing things makes more sense in higher dimensions when there 
				are more options for which axes to collapse.
			</p>
		</example>

		<example>
		<p>
			NumPy supports several other aggregating functions as well.
			<idx><h>standard deviation</h></idx>
			<idx><h>mean</h></idx>
			<c>np.prod()</c>,
			<c>np.mean()</c>, 
			<c>np.std()</c>,
			<c>np.var()</c>,
			<c>np.min()</c>, and 
			<c>np.max()</c> compute the product, mean, standard deviation variance, minimum,
			and maximum, collapsing over the specified axis or axes.
			And for boolean arrays, we can use <c>np.all()</c> and <c>np.any()</c>.
		</p>

		<p>Replace <c>mean()</c> with one of the other aggregating functions in the cell 
			below to see how they work.
		</p>
			<sage language="python">
				<input>
A = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
print("no axis specified: ", A.mean( keepdims = True))
print("axis = 0:\n", A.mean(axis = 0, keepdims = True))
print("axis = 1:\n", A.mean(axis = 1, keepdims = True))
				</input>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-ndarray-append">
	<title>Expanding an array</title>

	<p>
		Sometimes it is useful to build up a matrix or other <m>n</m>-dimensional
		array bit by bit or to add an additional "layer" (think row or column) to an 
		existing array. For example, to create an augmented matrix, we will often 
		append an additional column matrix to an existing matrix, increasing the number 
		of columns by one. <c>np.append()</c> allows us to do this, provided our arrays 
		(a) have the same number of dimensions and (b) compatible shapes along the desired 
		axis.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's an example where we add a column onto a <m>3 \by 2 </m> matrix.
	</p>

		<sage language="python">
			<input>
A = np.arange(6).reshape((3,2))
b = np.array([5, 3, 2])
Aplus = np.append(A, b.reshape(3,1), 1) # need to make b 2-d first
print(Aplus)
			</input>
			<output>
[[0 1 5]
 [2 3 3]
 [4 5 2]]
			</output>
		</sage>
	<p>
		Notice that <c>np.append()</c> does not modify its arguments. It returns a new (larger) array.
	</p>

	<p>
		NumPy provides several other functions that can be used to create larger arrays by combining smaller arrays.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<c>np.concetentate()</c> takes a sequence of arrays and repeatedly appends. This is especially 
					useful for combining three or more arrays. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<c>np.stack()</c> (and specialized versions
					<c>np.hstack()</c> and <c>np.vstack()</c> concatenate along
					a <em>new</em> axis. This can be used to combine vectors
					into an array or arrays into a tensor. The resulting object
					will have a higher dimension (more axes) than the inputs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					For working with matrices and vectors, <c>np.column_stack()</c> is handy since will  
					treat 1-dimensional arrays as 2-dimensional column vectors, making it easy to add 
					vectors as new columns of a matrix.
				</p>
				<sage language="python">
					<input>
A = np.arange(6).reshape((3,2))
b = np.array([5, 3, 2])
Aplus2 = np.column_stack((A, b))          # no need to make 2-d or specify axis
print(Aplus2)
					</input>
				<output>
[[0 1 5]
 [2 3 3]
 [4 5 2]]
			</output>
		</sage>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<c>np.block()</c> creates a new array from a nested sequences of blocks. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<c>np.insert()</c> allows insertion into a slice.  
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
					
			<p>
					In scenes were some regions are very bright and others very dark, it can be challenging 
					to create a good exposure over the entire image. Exposure bracketing is a technique that has 
					been used since the 1850's to help with this situation. This technique involves capturing 
					multiple images, each with a different exposure. Later one can choose the best of the captured 
					images or combine them in some way.  In the 1850's, Gustave Le Gray printed seascape photos 
					from two images, using one exposure for the sky and the other for the water. Modern HDR methods 
					can combine multiple digital images in much more complex ways.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this example we stack multiple images with different exposures and use a very 
				simple method (averaging) to convert the stack of images into a single HDR (high dynamic range) 
				image. 
				<idx><h>high dynamic range (HDR) images</h></idx>
				This works because each images loses some information in the brightest or darkest regions 
				due to the limits on the values (typically 0 to 255) that each pixel may have. The averages will remain 
				in the appropriate range, but do a better job of distinguishing among the very dark and very bright 
				regions of the image.
			</p>

			<p>
				The images were obtained from 
				<url href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:StLouisArchMultExpEV%2B1.51.JPG">WikiMedia</url>.
				We will use low resolutoin images below, but you can repeat this example with higher resolution 
				images if you like. Notice the use of <c>np.stack()</c> to combine the images into one 4-dimensional 
				tensor, and the use of <c>np.rint()</c> and <c>astype(int)</c> to make sure the resulting data 
				is again integer (the nearest integer to the average).

		<title>Broadcasting</title>

		<p>
			According to the NumPy documentation, 
		</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
				The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with
				different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to
				certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the
				larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting
				provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping
				occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making
				needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm
				implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is
				a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that
				slows computation.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

		<p>
			For many operations on arrays, the shapes of the two arrays must be identical.
			Broadcasting allows us to relax that condition.  Two arrays are said to be
			<term>broadcastable</term> to the same shape if when working from the tail (rightmost) 
			end of the shape each dimension is <term>compatible</term>.  Dimensions are 
			compatible if 
			<ol>
				<li><p> They are equal, or</p></li>
				<li><p> One of them is 1, or</p></li>
				<li><p> One of them is missing. </p></li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, suppose two arrays <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have shapes 
			<m>(3, 1, 10)</m> and <m>(5, 10)</m>.
			Working backwards, we first compare the two 10's .  
			They are equal, so they are compatible.
			Then we compare the 1 and the 5. They are not equal, but one of them is 1, 
			so they are compatible.
			Finally, we compare 3 to a missing dimension.  These are also compatbile.
		</p>

		<p>
			Broadcasting will treat each array is if it had shape <m>(3, 5, 10)</m>.  To do 
			that, each array must be "stretched".  Broadcasting treats <m>A</m> as if it 
			were <m>A^*</m> with <m>A^*[i, j, k] == A[i, 1, k]</m>.
			Similarly, <m>B</m> is treated as if it were <m>B^*</m> with 
			<m> B^*[i,j,k] = B[j, k]</m>.  That is, each array is treated as if data were 
			copied to fill in the missing dimensions. 
			Importantly for computational efficiency, this copying does not actually happen.
			But conceptually, we can imagine that copying if it helps us understand how 
			the arrays are made compatible.
		</p>

		<p>
			The simplest form of broadcasting is when a scalar is broadcast to make it 
			compatible with an array. In this case it is as if an array of the same size 
			were filled entirely with that single scalar value.
		</p>
